# Command Line Sudoku

## About
This program is a command line python program that generates a sudoku puzzle and then awaits user input. Once the user guesses a number for a specific tile, the program responds and updates the puzzle appropriately. When the puzzle has been completed successfully, the user may choose to generate another puzzle and continue playing.

## How to Use
1. Python3 should be downloaded to use this program. To check if you have Python3 downloaded use this code to check for a version: `python3 --version`.
2. Once Python3 is downloaded, navigate to the project folder and type: `python main.py`.
3. When prompted, each input must be formatted in this way: r"row number"c"column number" "number that you want to input" (e.g. "row 2, column 3 = 6" will be `r2c3 6`)
4. Enjoy!
